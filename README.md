## Flask Application Design: Landing Page for Computer Sales Website

## HTML Files

- `index.html`: This file will serve as the homepage of the landing page. It will feature product listings, promotional content, and relevant information for customers seeking computers.
- `product_details.html`: This file will display specific details of individual computer products. When a user clicks on a product listing on the homepage, they will be directed to this page for more information.

## Routes

- `/`: This route will serve the `index.html` file, rendering the homepage of the landing page.
- `/product/<product_id>`: This route will serve the `product_details.html` file, passing the specified product ID in the URL to display detailed information about that product.
- `/about-us`: This route will serve an `about_us.html` file, providing background and information about the company or organization behind the computer sales website.
- `/contact-us`: This route will serve a `contact_us.htm` file, offering contact details and methods for customers to engage with the business.

## Design Rationale

This Flask application design provides a structured framework for creating a functional landing page for a computer sales website. The HTML files are designed to separate content into logical sections, while the routes allow for dynamic page loading based on user interaction. The overall design aims to provide a user-friendly and informative experience for customers browsing the website.
